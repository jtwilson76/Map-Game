# Map-Game
Map game finalized recreationally by Anna Floyd, Ryan Sheffield, and Jacob Wilson.

Scope of the Project moving forward: 

CSV files needed for win conditions and for the map itself. Take as much freedom with those designs as you want. 

Possible graphics inclusion? Not necessary for final design, but more than willing to look into it if you want. 

Go to the players CSV, I believe there are characters already in place. Feel free to change them or add more depending on what you want out of this. 

My overall vision is to collaborate with you both and build a project we are all satisfied with. If you need any assistance or have any questions, please call me at any time. I appreciate your willingness to collaborate. So, let's have fun with this!
